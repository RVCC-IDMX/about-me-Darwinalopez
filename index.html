                <P> I want to be... </P>

                <P> A successful person </P>

                <P> I like to play Baritone horn!</P>

                <P> This past year I was a member of the Reading Buccaneers Drum and Bugle Corps,
                     a marching ensemble that operates and competes every weekend in the northeast area.</P>
                <P> I intend on auditioning for a world class Drum Corps, They operate all summer so you stay with them from mid may through august. 
                    It's very physically and mentally intensive and a great opportunity to learn and to perform to tens of thousands of people in the country.</P>
                <P>I like motorcycles,</P>

                <P> I have owned a motorcycle for the past two year. It has become one of my favorite hobbies, it's really calming for me. </P>

                <P> I am very interested in aviation! </P>
                <P> I have started flight lessons before, however it was too expensive for me to continue; but that hasn't stopped me from loving aviation!
                    I intend on completing flight training in the future!
                </P>

        <p>The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start. On your mark, get ready, start.
