                <P> I want to be... </P>

                <P> A successful person </P>

                <P> I like to play Baritone horn!</P>

                <P> This past year I was a member of the Reading Buccaneers Drum and Bugle Corps,
                     a marching ensemble that operates and competes every weekend in the northeast area.</P>
                <P> I intend on auditioning for a world class Drum Corps, They operate all summer so you stay with them from mid may through august. 
                    It's very physically and mentally intensive and a great opportunity to learn and to perform to tens of thousands of people in the country.</P>
                <P>I like motorcycles,</P>

                <P> I have owned a motorcycle for the past two year. It has become one of my favorite hobbies, it's really calming for me. </P>

                <P> I am very interested in aviation! </P>
                <P> I have started flight lessons before, however it was too expensive for me to continue; but that hasn't stopped me from loving aviation!
                    I intend on completing flight training in the future!
                </P>
